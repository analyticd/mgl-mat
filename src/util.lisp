;;; A thread safe, reentrant caching mechanism with a separate cache

;;; WITH-THREAD-CACHED-OBJECT in the sources if PLACE is not
;;; specified).
;;;
;;; Conceptually, the thread cache associates a (THREAD PLACE KEY)
;;; triplet with an object. THREAD is the current thread. PLACE is
;;; specified explicitly or it is a gensym unique to each occurrence
;;; of WITH-THREAD-CACHED-OBJECT. KEY is provided by the user.
;;;
;;; Before BODY is executed, VAR is bound to the object associated
;;; with (THREAD PLACE KEY). When BODY is finished, the same triplet
;;; is associated with the then current binding of VAR which may have
;;; been changed by BODY.
;;;
;;; In the example below, ARRAY is bound to an array of the
