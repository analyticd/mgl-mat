  "This is the libray on which \\MGL-MAT (see MGL-MAT:@MAT-MANUAL) is
  built. The idea of automatically translating between various
  representations may be useful for other applications, so this got
  its own package and all ties to \\MGL-MAT has been severed.

  This package defines CUBE, an abstract base class that provides a
  framework for automatic conversion between various representations
  of the same data. To define a cube, CUBE needs to be subclassed and
  the @FACET-EXTENSION-API be implemented.

  If you are only interested in how to use cubes in general, read
  @CUBE-BASICS, @DESTRUCTION-OF-CUBES and @FACET-BARRIER.

  If you want to implement a new cube datatype, then see
  @FACET-EXTENSION-API, @DEFAULT-CALL-WITH-FACET* and @CUBE-VIEWS.")
